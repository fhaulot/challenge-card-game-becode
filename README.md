# challenge-card-game-becode
Second Becode project

# Description

The purpose here is to set a card game with Object Oriented Programming in Python. 
The Card and Symbol class define the attributes of a playing card
The Player class define the player and how to play the game once all the cards are distributed
The Deck class will fill the deck will all the 52 cards. 

Unfortunately, we couldn't manage to go further than those classes. The Game and Main files are empty (for now!)
 
# Installation
This files are using Python 3.13 and Jupyter Notebook for the test 

# Usage
In final times, we should launch the main.py file to run all the script and files.
